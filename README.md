SameBoy is a well written emulator, i've used it as inspiration for many parts of my code and for that reasone it may look similar (or identical) to SameBoy's (*first commit*) source code.

This projects is a way to understand how to write emulators (the only one i'll write in my entire life i guess), and to gain good coding practices.
